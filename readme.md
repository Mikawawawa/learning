## It's a repo to store my PHP class's homework

### [Class one] build the enviroment on LNMP
caz I reload my laptop,I missed all my code TAT,and I have to build the enviroment again.

### [Class two] The usage of Array and function in PHP
I got something new today at the class.
- sort()
- rsort()
- ksort()
- array_shift()
- etc

the static varity means that the varity will be declared **once** !

Also,I find when I use foreach to traverse an array,it may throw a notice said undefined offset,though the truth isn't like the notice.
I use > error_reporting('Notice'); to cover it.
